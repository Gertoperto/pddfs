# Parallel Distributed Depth First Search (PDDFS)
Implementation of Musaev's PDDFS algorithm.

For future reference, completed thesis work.

## Abstract from thesis
Musaev proposed a parallel distributed depth-first search (DDFS) algorithm. 
Its claims are in contradiction to Reif’s formal argument that depth-first search is inher-ently sequential. 
We discover errors in Musaev’s algorithm, provide potential solutions, and argue that it is not feasible to achieve performance better than that of existingsequential-like DDFS algorithms.
